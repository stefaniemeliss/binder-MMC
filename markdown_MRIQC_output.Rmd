```

This markdown summarises the output from MRIQC (https://mriqc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about.html, version 0.16.1), a tool developed by the Poldrack Lab at Stanford University. The software implements nipype workflows relying on FSL, ANTs and AFNI and extracts IQMs (Image Quality Metrics) from functional and anatomical data. The focus is to examine whether there are any patterns relating to group, task and experimental time course in the IQMs derived from **functional** data. Raw nifti files were used as imput, however, the time series acquired during the magic trick watching task was cut so that it only includes volumes covering the task. This was necessary because the scanner was stopped manually at the end of the task.  

Due to the fact that many IQMs are no-reference metrics, context is provided for both, functional and anatomical data by comparing the IQMs obtained from our data set to crowd-sourced data from the MRIQC web API (Esteban et al., 2019).  

The workflow was specified as the following:  
* threshold for frame wise displacement 0.5 (this is similar to what has been suggested by Powers et al., 2012).
* despiking and slice timing correction has been performed
  
All functional images share the following scan paramters: 

* Slice Resolution: 64x64
* Num slices: 37
* Voxel Size: 3.0x3.0x3.75
* TR = 2000ms
* Num Volumes: rest = 300 (each), magictricks = 1140 (in total)  

All anatomical images share the following scan paramters: 

* Resolution: 192x256x256
* spacing: x = 0.94, y = 0.9375, z = 0.9375  

# Functional data IQM exploration

The first section focuses on the IQMs derived from functional files providing a summary for each of them. Below, each metrics is defined (definitions have been copied from https://sarenseeley.github.io/BIDS-fmriprep-MRIQC.html#mriq) and interpreted.    
Additionally, for each of the metrics, **four graphs** have been created to examine effects of task, group and time course of the experiment:  

a) Histogram for all scans  
Data from control and experimental group is shown in dark and light gray, respectively. Moreover, mean and median are added using vertical lines in red and green and their values together with their variance (standard deviation (SD) and median absolute deviation (MAD)) are annotated in the corresponding colour.  
b) Histogram divided by group (control vs experimental) and task (magictricks vs rest)  
Similar to the histogram for all scans, mean and median and respective measures of variance are highlighted seperatly for each cell. Additionally, effects for group and task are tested inference-statistically using a linear mixed-effects model predicting the given metric using task and group while specifying random intercepts for subject and acquisition (metrics ~ group + task + (1 | ID) + (1 | acqusition)).  
c) Boxplot for each acquisition (magictricks_run-1 vs. magictricks_run-2 vs. magictricks_run-3 vs. rest_run-1 vs. rest_run-2)  
In the boxplots, outliers are determined as: value < quantile(value, 0.25) - 1.5 * IQR(value) | value > quantile(value, 0.75) + 1.5 * IQR(value). If a value is regarded as outlier, it is using the subject's ID. The labels are printed in black if this subject belongs to the control group and in grey if the subject belongs to the experimental group.
d) Spaghettiplot highlighting the time course across the experiment of each of these metrics for each subject  
In the spaghetti plot, a subject is labeled if any of the values over time were larger than mean(value) + 1SD(value). Please note that the line for subject 16 makes a little dip for magictricks_run-2. This is because the scanner had to be stopped during the second block, so there are two acqusitions (both covering approximately half of the block). To provide summary statistics, the IQM was standardised across the sample before computing mean, standard deviation, and range within each subject.

# Comparison between this data set and web API data

As a last step, two sets (functional and anatomical seperately) of violin plots were created showing the data from this data set on the left side and the data from the web API (Esteban et al, 2019, Scientific Data) on the right side. The plots were created for each QC metric individually. To reduce scaling issues, outliers were removed in the API data. For our data set, outliers were not removed. Hovering over each data point on the left side allows to access information on the data point (file, value, outlier TRUE/FALSE). These plots are intended to provide some context for the non-reference QC metrics.  
  
Taking a similar approach to mriqception (https://github.com/elizabethbeard/mriqception), families of IQMs are colour-coded. In each plot, the API data is shown in gray, and the present data set is shown in the corresponding colour for each metric's family. IQM descriptions were taken from the mriqception repository (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elizabethbeard/mriqception/master/tools/iqm_descriptions.csv).  
  
* spatial IQMs (fwhm_avg, fwhm_x, fwhm_y, fwhm_z, fber, efc): gold  
* temporal IQMs (tsnr, gcor, dvars_nstd, dvars_std, dvars_vstd): orange  
* noise IQM (snr, snr_?, snrd_? cjv, cnr, qi_2): red  
* motion IQMs (fd_num, fd_perc, fd_mean): green *(functional data only)*  
* artefact IQMs (inu_med, inu_range, wm2max): pink *(anatomical data only)*  
* descriptive IQMs (summary_fg_?,  summary_bg_?): blue  
* other IQMs ("aor", "aqi", "dummy_trs", "gsr_x", "gsr_y"): purple
